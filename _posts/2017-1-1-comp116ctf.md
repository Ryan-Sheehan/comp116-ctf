### Executive Summary

During the Capture the Flag Competition our team successfully found and exploited a number
of vulnerabilities in the given target server. The vulnerabilities identified included: SQL injection, 
CVE-2017-14867, and publicly exposed cleartext information. Structural problems included improper
exposure of sensitive information and improperly handled user input. To create a more secure
server we recommend that the owner should be more vigilant in keeping the tools/codebases that 
the website is reliant on up to date and to have an expert write new methods for parsing user input.


### Introduction

The goal of the capture the flag game was to find vulnerabilities in a server, http://35.226.171.155/, and report a key that was located there to show that we found the specific vulnerability. This was achieved by using the tactics we have learned in class such as SQL / command injection, URL manipulation, and shodan among others. We found a total of 4 flags that were associated with hints 1, 2, 4, and 9. If we continued to work on this we had plans to use sqlmap and ZAP to aid us in vulnerability detection. All the keys found were done so without the aid of automated vulnerability detection services. 

### Tools/Resources Used

- Google Developer Tools
- https://www.cvedetails.com/
- Kali Linux VM
- Shodan.io
- whois
- ssh
- ping
- nmap

<p class="encrypted">Challenge 1</p>
> 100 points
>
> Hint: GET the Flag.
>
> Method: url manipulation

The hint here is implying that by indexing the site (using GET requests) in some way probably not anticipated by the the owner of the server, we will be able to find a key as is. As such, all that is needed to get this
key is to send a GET request to the following url:

```ruby
http://35.226.171.155/FLAG
```

This GET request immediately downloads the key from the server in a plaintext file.

<p class="encrypted">Challenge 2</p>
> 150 points
>
> Hint: .git the FLAG.
>
> Method: Known Git vulnerability

For this challenge, we assumed the hint was implying we should look for some vulnerability common to 
servers using git. By searching for 'git cve vulnerability', we came across this:

![img-smpl]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.assets_path}}/img/git-cve.png)

Some further research revealed that this vulnerability created a public facing .git directory on the server 
containing copious amounts of metadata about the server owner's git history as well as other sensitive files.
The directory looked like this:
![img-smpl]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.assets_path}}/img/git-directory.png)

And as we can see, tucked in the middle there is our flag.

![img-smpl]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.assets_path}}/img/flag-2.png)


<p class="encrypted">Challenge 4</p>
> 200 points
>
> Hint: Don't ask me if something looks wrong. Look again, pay careful attention. 
>
> Method: SQL-Injection

This challenge required a couple of steps. First, after we had seen how we could access parts of the server 
the owner did not intend by simply trying hidden routes, we spent some time trying some extensions on the end of the target url to see if any of the routes resolved. Eventually we found that by adding the extension 

```ruby
http://35.226.171.155/admin.php
```

We were brought to a login screen.

![img-smpl]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.assets_path}}/img/login.png)

By using the simple SQL-injection command of
```ruby
 hi' OR '1'='1
```

for both the username and password, we were brought to a page that looked like this:

![img-smpl]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.assets_path}}/img/main-404.png)

We were unsure what exactly to do with this page but while inspecting the html elements for clues we came across this:
![img-smpl]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.assets_path}}/img/main-php.png)

A flag!

<p class="encrypted">Challenge 9</p>
> 300 points
>
> Hint: I am eval Homer. 
>
> Method: XSS

From the last challenge, we had gotten to the screen that asked: "Looking for Evil Homer?" so we figured
we were on the right path. By following the link we were brought here:
![img-smpl]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.assets_path}}/img/homer.png)
Pretty clear instructions, so we obliged:
![img-smpl]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.assets_path}}/img/homer-id.png)

Seeing as we now knew we could send parameters directly to the server using the url, we figured we ought to try adding some commands onto the end and seeing what could get executed. As we had seen there was a /FLAG route available before, we wanted to check if this target had one as well. The command to print a file on a system would be 
```ruby
 cat /FLAG;
```

We're almost there. We also need to add an echo before our cat so get a string returned rather than the command just being run on the target server and leaving its evaluation only in their server logs. This gives us a final string of

```ruby
 echo `cat /FLAG`;
```

Lastly, we can append this on to the end of the ID parameter in the url as such:

```ruby
 http://34.74.110.173/?id=homer;echo `cat /FLAG`;
```
The semicolon after the homer parameter tells the system to execute the following commands we inserted as a seperate line of code. Entering this new url returns us:
![img-smpl]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.assets_path}}/img/homer-key.png)
